# Bank Profitability Analysis by Ratio Analysis (Quant Finance)
Every firm is most concerned with its profitability and financial performance. One of the most 
frequently used tools of financial ratio analysis is profitability ratios , which are used to 
determine the company’s profitability position and financial performance position and its 
return to its investors. 
Profitability and performance  measures are important to company managers and owners alike. 
If a small business has outside investors who have put their own money into the company, the 
company certainly has to show profitability to those equity investors as well as good financial 
performance. 
Profitability Ratios show a company’s overall efficiency and performance. 
What I’am trying to show through this study is the profitability and performance of 6 banks 
(HDFC, ICICI, AXIS, SBI, BANK OF BARODA,PUNJAB NATIONAL BANK )  3 of them belongs to the 
pvt sectors and 3 of them are public sector units. I’am  going to show this based on last 6 years 
data. Based on my study and I’am going to conclude that which bank(s) is in a better position in 
respect of profitability and financial performance point of view and over 6 years which bank’s 
growth rate / progress has been better in respect of profitability and performance point of 
view.
